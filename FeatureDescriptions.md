### Name of the feature: Movie Database

Description: This feature aims to create a database to store movie and TV show information, including ratings. Users can add, view, search, and delete movies or TV shows from the database.

Implementation strategy: The feature is implemented using Node.js and MongoDB. The movie and TV show data is stored in a MongoDB database, and the feature uses the MovieBusiness and movieDAO modules to interact with the database. The feature provides a RESTful API that handles HTTP requests and responses using Express.js.

Dependencies: This feature depends on the MovieBusiness and movieDAO modules and the MongoDB database for storage.

State of implementation: The feature is partially complete. The database and API have been set up, and the MovieBusiness and movieDAO modules have been created. However, some API endpoints may not be fully implemented, and testing and error handling may need to be improved.
